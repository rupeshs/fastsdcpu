# FastSD CPU :sparkles:

FastSD CPU is a faster version of Stable Diffusion on CPU. Based on [Latent Consistency Models](https://github.com/luosiallen/latent-consistency-model).
The application available as :
- Desktop GUI (Qt)
- WebUI 
- CLI (CommandLine Interface)

Took 10 seconds to generate single 512x512 image on Core i7-12700(With OpenVINO).

## Supported platforms
 - Windows
 - Linux
 - Raspberry PI 4
 - Mac (Need testers)

## Features
- Supports 256,512,768 image sizes
- Supports Windows and Linux
- Saves images and diffusion setting used to generate the image
- Settings to control,steps,guidance and seed
- Added safety checker setting
- Maximum inference steps increased to 25
- Added OpenVINO support
- Added web UI 
- Added CommandLine Interface
- Fixed OpenVINO image reproducibility issue
- Fixed OpenVINO high RAM usage,thanks [deinferno](https://github.com/deinferno) 
- Added more than one image support
- Stores and loads settings

## OpenVINO support

Thanks [deinferno](https://github.com/deinferno) for the OpenVINO model contribution.
We can get 2X speed improvement when using OpenVINO. 

## LCM Models 

Currently LCM model(Dreamshaper_v7) is supported (Diffuser format).

## Google Colab
Due to the limitation of using CPU/OpenVINO inside colab, we are using GPU with colab.

 Open the terminal and enter into fastsdcpu folder.
 Activate virtual environment using the command:
#### Windows users :
 (Suppose it is in the d drive "d:\fastsdcpu")
  `d:\fastsdcpu\env\Scripts\activate.bat`

#### Posix users:
  `source env/bin/activate`

Start CLI by `src/app.py -h`
## Raspberry PI 4 support

Thanks WGNW_MGM for Raspberry PI 4 testing.FastSD CPU worked without problems.
System configuration - Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM, 8GB of SWAP memory.
